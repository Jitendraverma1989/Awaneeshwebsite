This folder should contain your website images.

## Recommended Images to Add:

### Logo

### Clients
- Client logo images (PNG with transparent backgrounds recommended)

### Team/Testimonials

### Icons
- Custom service icons (if not using Font Awesome)

## Current Setup

The website currently uses:
- Font Awesome icons for services and features
- Placeholder images from placeholder.com
- Icon fonts for client logos

## To Add Your Images:

1. Add images to this folder
2. Update the image paths in `index.html`
3. Optimize images for web (compress to reduce file size)

### Image Optimization Tips:
- Use WebP format for better compression
- Compress JPG/PNG files using tools like TinyPNG
- Recommended dimensions:
  - Portfolio images: 800x600px
  - Client logos: 200x100px
  - Testimonial photos: 300x300px

**Note:** For now, the website uses Font Awesome icons and placeholder images, so it will work perfectly without adding actual images.
